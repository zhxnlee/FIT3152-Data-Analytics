"The added frisson in the case of the aforementioned 000 14-fretters was the use of sinker mahogany, the 300-year-old timber adding additional zest to Martin’s renowned tonal spectrum. Here, we’re continuing our look at the celebrated acoustic manufacturer’s new catalogue with this Modern Deluxe model. And the theme of enhancing the range with a few well-chosen refinements - many of which have trickled down from Custom Shop instruments - continues apace. It would be easy to split our look into three sections of classic, modern and deluxe. As far as the classic section is concerned, this model has been in Martin’s inventory since the early 1900s. The earliest mention of the triple-0 we could find goes all the way back to 1902. Understandably, as far as body woods are concerned, it has gone through a few changes over the years. But it is undoubtedly classic a Martin, right down to the dovetail neck joint and the protein glue that’s used in the construction. Moving on to the modern appointments here and first we find titanium truss rods - more hard-wearing than steel but most importantly much lighter. Martin claims the use of titanium reduces the weight of the truss rod by around 64 per cent when compared with its steel counterpart. The reduction in weight overall is certainly one of the first things you notice when you pick up this instrument. Second in line and adding to the modern features are composite carbon-fibre bridge plates, which are essentially ‘sandwiches’ comprising two outer layers of carbon fibre with a filling of Adirondack spruce. Martin’s vice president, Fred Greene, tells us that carbon fibre by itself didn’t give the tonal properties they were looking for, but when combined with the spruce layer they hit upon the perfect combination of strength and tonal enhancement. What’s more, the new bridge plate is responsible for another drop in weight, but, tonally speaking, has added sparkle to the guitar’s sound and a slight increase in volume, too. It’s also more durable and extremely strong. Another modern touch is the inclusion of Liquidmetal bridge pins. We realise that the jury is still out with regards to what different materials offer as far as bridge pins are concerned. Some luthiers claim it makes no difference at all seeing theyare beyond the string saddle and therefore don’t have a role in the tone-shaping stakes. Others insist that experimentation in this vicinity can practically turn lead into gold, tonally speaking. A quick look on the web will confirm that companies all over the net are queueing up to sell you fossilised mammoth bone, brass or whatever, adding that the difference in sound is worth the sometimes eye-watering price. We’re sitting on the fence here as it’s difficult to prove either way. Bridge pin changes often accompany a new set of strings and so the uplift in brightness and sustain might easily eclipse whatever it is that the pins are providing. However, Liquidmetal is a space-age alloy that, simply put, doesn’t absorb vibration in the way that other materials do, rather it reflects it. So using bridge pins made from Liquidmetal theoretically puts any vibration found at this point straight back into the guitar. The guys at Martin found that using them increased an instrument’s volume by three to five decibels. We’ll see what our ears tell us on this score a little later on. Last in line for the modern touches is Martin’s VTS system of heat-treating a guitar’s top and bracing to give some of the timbral qualities of vintage instruments, as well as offering an antique visual aesthetic at the same time. So what about the deluxe refinements? These are obvious the minute you open the case. First of all, there’s the pearl logo on the headstock - a luxurious green abalone sheen that whispers class from the outset. Then there are the gold-plated Waverly tuners that add to the overall visual appeal of the guitars. Less noticeable, perhaps, is the flamed maple wood binding. Finally, there are the gold frets - not real gold, of course, but an alloy with a visible copper content that gives a classy golden appearance, matching the tuners and living up to Martin’s claim for the Modern Deluxe series that ‘Sophistication Meets Performance’. But the frets haven’t received the Midas touch for purely cosmetic purposes; the alloy in use is much stronger and longer lasting than steel and pitched just a little way beneath stainless steel for wear-resistance. We’ve played many variations on the 000-28 before, from stock models right up to Custom Shop works of art. So we had a sort of benchmark in mind for this guitar before we even played a note on them. We’ve already mentioned the weight reduction: it is much lighter than many instruments bearing the same lineage, and the deluxe appointments speak for themselves - this guitar looks fabulous. But what about the sound? To begin with it would seem Martin’s claim that the Modern Deluxe range enjoys a step up as far as volume is concerned is fully justifiable. It seems louder than models that have come our way in the past. Whether that’s due to the carbon-fibre bridge plates, the Liquidmetal bridge pins or a combination of both is impossible to pinpoint, given that we’re not in the business of laboratory type testing. There’s volume - and projection - to spare. The 000-28 became an instant office favourite, its familiar tones having seemingly received a supercharge. It’s an easy guitar to sit or stand with, too, but the triple-0 and OM models always were decidedly lap-friendly. We tested the 000-28 in quite a large room, and one that has a tendency to dissipate the bass end of an acoustic guitar. This model held its own admirably, the proportion of bass to treble remaining constant and very sensitive to touch. Want more? Pluck louder. Simple. Martin’s mission to evolve its heritage by enhancing the range in the way we’ve seen here is to be applauded. We can imagine that all the new-fangled ideas that are going on with the Modern Deluxes - both seen and unseen - may be in conflict with comfort-zone sensibilities of the traditionalists, but to those fine gentlefolk we would wholeheartedly recommend auditioning one. The difference you find here is real with additional volume, enhanced projection, greater sustain - and that’s on top of the renowned Martin tone. You really can’t go wrong. ",martin-000-28-modern-deluxe
"Its search for sustainable alternatives to the old favourites have given us Urban Ash, trees harvested from city trees across Southern California that were getting felled anyway, and a tonewood that compares favourably with mahogany. And this new 514CE Grand Auditorium is one of two new models to continue this urban initiative with a cutaway body comprising a back and sides of solid Urban Ironbark. It sounds kind of heavy metal but is anything but, with Taylor suggesting that Urban Ironbark use a sustainable rosewood substitute, sitting somewhere between that and mahogany, and ergo an acoustic guitar that the fingerstylists should sit up and take notice of. You might also recognise Urban Ironbark as red ironbark, the sweet-smelling eucalyptus sideroxylon that is much favoured by pollinators and can be found across eastern Australia – and across the parks and green spaces of Santa Barbara. Anyway, it scrubs up beautifully on a Taylor guitar, complementing the torrefied solid Sitka spruce top with a deep and rich, attractive grain. The craft here is off the charts. This is Taylor doing Taylor things, applying a none-more-tactile satin finish to the neck and a thin skin of gloss to the back and sides. The top has been stained but ever so subtly with a tobacco burst. It’s a finish that doesn’t call attention to itself and gives what is a box-fresh new build a sense of history. This 514CE belongs to Taylor’s V-Class models, with Andy Powers’ innovative bracing pattern promising an acoustic that is louder and sustains longer, and perhaps that belies the size of the instrument, which is smaller than a dread’, bigger than the Grand Concert models. Introduced in 1994 as its “signature shape”, it is Taylor’s best-selling body shape and looks to split the difference between the boom and power of the flatpicker’s dread and the Grand Concerts and 000 models that fingerstylists favoured. Perhaps it is on models such as this where the V-Class bracing comes into its own, making the most of the dimensions, and getting every bit of volume out of it. Elsewhere, we have Taylor’s industry-standard Expression System 2 pickup and preamp – its reputation for excellence preceding it – a West African ebony fingerboard inlaid with Italian pearloid and bound with ebony sitting atop a South American mahogany neck. The frets are medium-fine. The tuners come from Schaller but are Taylor-branded. Guitar playing has its specialisms and thus has its specialist designs to cater for such styles, but perhaps the Grand Auditorium has been so successful for the brand precisely because it can excel in different styles. This 514CE is just so amenable to players of all persuasions. Strum a chord and it has a lot of raw power – much of that punch and volume surely courtesy of the V-Class bracing – but there’s a honeyed quality to the upper mids and treble that gives it superb balance. It’s dynamic. Set your pick aside and it has all the delicacy you need to make a folk tune sing. This might be introducing a new tonewood to the general public but you will find references in the sounds that you can tease out of the instrument, hints of classic dreadnoughts of yore, and all in all a guitar that is so dialled-in EQ-wise. The balance is not just across the frequency spectrum, but from string to string too. Taylor’s Expression System 2 continues to impress with its behind-the-saddle configuration ensuring that your tone isn’t plasticised when amplified. As you would expect from Taylor, the attention to detail is second to none, and it is a hugely tactile instrument, with a neck profile that is ostensibly a C shape with a little V, and it is familiar, comfortable, and perfect for a guitar that only strengthens Taylor’s reputation for buttery playability. This is a very slinky acoustic, with the soft Venetian cutaway an invitation to wander up the ‘board for solos. Again, the 514CE’s balance is bang on; those notes in the upper register ring. The neck is solid, too, with the headstock attached to the body via a scarf joint. Guitarists, by definition, are all tree-huggers, and thus it is difficult to understate the importance of finding new alternatives to our favourite tonewoods, reducing the pressure on vulnerable ecosystems, and building a future for guitar-making. But this is not just about finding new tonewoods but the ability to integrate them into a design that sells them as a concept to players. Taylor has done that with Urban Ash and has done so again with Urban Ironbark, proving that stately, highly desirable materials can be found right under our noses, and when manipulated with such craft they make for instruments that compare favourably to anything else on the market. And if they are sounding this good now, what will they be like in three decades’ time? Some players might be put off by that. The 514CE is not cheap. But the craft, the tones and the feel are so persuasive that an acoustic that sounds like this now – albeit with some artificial ageing in the tone department courtesy of that torrefied spruce top – will only appreciate over time, and once these become sought-after on the vintage market you’ll be wishing you had got in at the ground floor. As aspirational acoustic guitars go, it doesn’t get much better than this.",taylor-514ce-urban-ironbark
"At first there’s surprise, maybe a little horror, too. The shock of the new is near overwhelming. But then the elite warms to the idea, embracing the new design’s potential. And so it was with the Fender American Acoustasonic Telecaster. The Strat and Jazzmaster versions followed, the latter the boldest yet. But there comes a point when said design has to be popularised; it has to graduate to mass appeal. That’s when it has to be more financially accessible. The Acoustasonic had to go mainstream, and it there was an obvious pathway: adding it Fender’s blockbuster Player Series. Ultimately, when the Player Series Acoustasonic Telecaster was announced, the reaction was not of shock but of ‘what took them so long?’ This, a 1000-dollar Acoustasonic, finally puts one of the most innovative guitar designs in recent history into the hands of more players. Once more, the Acoustasonic preamp technology – or the Acoustic Engine – is a two-hander between Fender and Fishman. Here it governs an under-saddle piezo and N4 Noiseless single-coil pickup. There key differences between the US and Player Series models are perhaps most tellingly in the electrics. The American model is chargeable via a USB connection mounted on the jack plate, whereas the Player Series Acoustasonic is powered by a 9V battery, accessed via a compartment on the rear of the instrument.  We have fewer choices when it comes to voices. The American Acoustasonic models featuring 10 voices, and the Player Series offering six from. These are accessible via a three-way blade selector switch and the blend knob, and still present us with a hitherto unparalleled level of versatility from a hybrid build at this price point. In position three, you’ll find a pair of mahogany small body short-scale and rosewood dreadnought acoustic voices. In position two, you have Lo-Fi Clean, which uses the under-saddle pickup alone, and Lo-Fi Crunch, which Fender says is to replicate the sound of an acoustic and an electric double tracked. Finally, in position one, you have the choice between the Noiseless Tele pickup and the Fat Noiseless Tele pickup voicing, which is to say you have the Tim Shaw-designed magnetic single-coil at your disposal, in both a clean mode and a sort of boosted, wider-sounding fat mode. As its name suggests, the blend control is more than just a two-way selector of voice modes; you can mix the two voices together to find the in between tones. Very clever. Now with all this tech, it’s easy to overlook just how revolutionary the physical design. Like its US-built kin, the Player Series Acoustasonic Telecaster has a Micro-Tilt neck angle adjustor for making setups a breeze. Not that it was needed here. The factory setup was slinky but buzz-free. Fender has used a piece of solid Sitka spruce for the top, with mahogany on the back and sides, and by now we are all used to the doughnut, right? Or to give the soundhole its proper name, the Stringed Instrument Resonance System (SIRS). The mahogany neck is carved into a Modern Deep C-shape profile and topped with a rosewood fingerboard with 22 narrow tall frets. There’s also a Graph Tech Tusq nut, a set of sealed and staggered die-cast tuners, and its worth noting that it ships with a set of Fender Dura-Tone coated phosphor bronze acoustic guitar strings (11-52), because it’s just one of the things that might have you caught asking yourself if you are playing an acoustic electric or and electric acoustic, and does it even matter anyway? Fundamentally, a fully hollow Telecaster with a soundhole and a convincing unplugged acoustic sound plus six on-tap voices makes for a whole lot of fun. To some players, a set of 11s on an electric guitar will make string bends seem like Olympic judo, but on this Acoustasonic hybrid format, it seems like a happy medium. Much of the physics of the Player Series Acoustasonic Telecaster are just that, finding the happy medium between electric and acoustic design. The compact body is less obtrusive than a typical acoustic, and allied with the neck and the 25.5” scale, it makes this feel like a Telecaster all right, albeit one that is all-neck when it comes to the weight. But even without going through an amplifier, it sounds good; tight, controlled, musical. Playing the Player Series Acoustasonic Tele unplugged doesn’t feel like you are just killing time before plugging in. When you do, there will be the question of whether a regular guitar amp or an acoustic guitar amp would be a better fit. This, of course, depends on how you intend to use the guitar. If you favour its two acoustic voices of position three, an acoustic amp is a better bet. But if you are approaching this as a Telecaster that just happens to have transmogrified into a bold acoustic electric hybrid then by all means your regular guitar amp should serve you well. Even in positions three, that piezo is rendered well. The acoustic voicings are well chosen. The rosewood dread voicing really does cater to the singer-songwriter who wants to hit a big chord and let it bloom, while the warmth and detail of the small-bodied acoustic voice is sure to be a hit with fingerstylists. The Lo Fi voicings are fascinating. Here is where the true hybrid tones are, and as such, there are fewer references for what we are hearing. The sound is just coming from the piezo and as you turn the blend control it adds drive. In a sense, this is a sound that almost exists outside of the spectrum of acoustic/electric tones, and is sure to support pedalboard experimentation. Park yourself on position one for a more traditional electric guitar experience, but don’t necessarily expect a traditional Telecaster experience. Fender promises twang but this isn’t Dwight Yoakam levels of twang. It is warmer, with a little more width than you’d expect from a Tele’s bridge pickup. That said, it can be pressed into service of many different kinds of styles, perhaps some that are all your own. That, in sum, is the sort of thing the Acoustasonic format encourages.",fender-acoustasonic-player-telecaster
"The Player Series takes Fender's classic electric guitar designs, offering a generous range of features for a tricked-out spec that makes them ideal for today's musician, then builds them at the Big F's Mexican factory and sells them at a very attractive price. Just like the Player Series Telecaster, you've got options with the Player Series Strat. You can have a maple or pau ferro ’board. There are HSS, HSH pickup configurations, as and if you are feeling fancy you've even got the flame maple-topped Plus Top and HSS Plus Top – at around £729 street, these top the range. All of these Strats feature a newly revised two-point vibrato and trio of newly Alnico V single coils. Our review model is quite traditionally spec'd and finished in Buttercream. Depending on how the light hits it it looks like Vintage Blonde or freshly dolloped custard, but nonetheless we've warmed to it. As with the Player Series Tele, there's a satin neck to provide a speedy playing experience, and there really are no quibbles with the build quality other than some slightly stiff tuners – but that's a minor thing. What you do have is a very wide range of tones spread from those pickups and the five-way selector. They recall Fender’s fat Texas Hot single coils and as such they work beautifully with gain; you don't lose any treble when rolling back the volume knob. The bridge pickup can be weedy on mid-priced Strats but here it is rich yet cutting – and if it gets a little on the spiky side, the tone knob is pleasingly responsive, and allows for a precise treble cut. This is a big deal for your tone. Let's look at the two tone knobs' wiring. Tone 1 handles your neck and middle pickups while tone 2 adjusts the bridge pickup. You won't find that on vintage Strats, which offer no control over the bridge pup, but it is incredibly useful. If the neck single coil lacks a little presence, it positively lights up when used in combination with the middle, which some serious quack attack on offer. The new two-point vibrato is neat. It's one of the smoothest-operating systems we’ve used at this price, returning perfectly to pitch. You might find that old familiar problem with the whammy bar coming loose in the socket problem but a little bit of tape around the thread will fix it. Strats are Strats and thus can never outrun their past; they will always pay homage to former glories, but what is great about the Player Series model is that it references tones from across the Strat's history and bring's them right up to date.",fender-player-stratocaster
"While Fender splits its guitars into series and periodically updates or refreshes them, Gibson’s main USA production division prefers the annual makeover approach. This year’s line-up was seen by many dealers as a return to form: “A new chapter in Gibson’s illustrious history, with their focus firmly back on crafting only the world’s finest guitars!” said one. As ever, the Les Paul sits central, with eight models (if we count The Paul 40th Anniversary) bookended by the start-up double-cut Les Paul Junior Tribute and topped off with the Les Paul High Performance. Add to the list the Les Paul Studio and Studio Tribute, and that leaves us with the three most classic Les Pauls, the Standard, Traditional and Classic. Today we’re looking at the Classic. The Classic is a catch-all name and for 2019 swaps its 2018-spec dual P-90s for ’61 Zebras and adds the circuit board previously used on the Standard, along with Traditional (aka nine-hole) weight relief. At £900 cheaper than the Standard, the 2019 Classic is essentially a stripped-down Les Paul before you drop to the Studios and is offered in Honeyburst (as here) or Gold Top - it was originally also offered in Ebony and Heritage Cherry Sunburst. Outwardly, all three of the 2019 models share the same construction (one-piece neck, headstock widening wings and two-piece centre-joined backs). The Classic features a A-less ‘plain top’ and ’61 Zebra open coil pickups. This Classic name has been applied to various-spec LPs since it appeared back in 1990, then in a highly vintage spec. Today’s more cost-effective dress, with its plain maple top, evokes a more 70s Deluxe style, enhanced by the metal-topped knobs. Unfortunately, that perception is reinforced by its weight, which makes it the porker here (despite its Traditional Weight Relief ) at a whooping 4.7kg/10.4lb. Grover Rotomatics reference one of the most common LP mods and we get a no-wire ABR-1 tune-o-matic. Likewise, the ’board appears very dry and with such low-profile frets you do really feel the ’board’s surface more than you would with a higher wire. String height is identical to the others and neck relief sits between the two. The Classic has an initial response that all points to a strong plugged-in performance. The Classic’s neck feels very similar to the recently-reviewed Standard, despite the differences, but the weight has a big impact, particularly on the hugely unbalanced feel played seated. Of course, if that doesn’t bother you, you might be on to a winner here as it’s a great player as supplied. Like any classic design, what you hear coming out of your amp might not be your idea of a great Les Paul tone, yet playing these three we’re hearing wonderful and subtly different flavours. It might well be that the Classic has the bite and power you like with more lower-end grunt than the others. There’s a little more nasally P-90 flavour, a slightly cocked-wah voice that provides a grainy texture, especially with some crunch and Marshall-y gain. Running the Classic with both pickups in tap mode is quite something; experiment with the phase switch with both pickups on to hear it. If only the damn thing wasn’t so heavy... The rather dowdy-looking Classic’s fundamental flaw is its colossal weight: in a different colour and with a lighter weight it might be game on, but that’s not what’s here. Plugged in, is where the Classic drops in: heft and grunt aplenty but with enough clarity to access older snappier and soulful voices. It will no doubt be a while until ‘new Gibson’ settles in and has a noticeable effect on the instruments we can buy. These interim models, however, are three strong dishes that employ existing features we’ve seen before, albeit not in quite the same combinations. With the horrors of ‘robotic’ tuners, over-wide necks and zero frets now pretty much consigned to the past, these three zone in on the Les Paul in classic style (Traditional), sonically expanded (Standard) and affordable (Classic) shades. They need a little TLC, which we’d hope would be undertaken before they’re sold, but they’re tidy, not over-priced and have the right name on the headstock. They might well be quite historic models, too: the end of an era. Just as we conclude our test at the start of 2019, the new Gibson management announced there will apparently be a completely new 2019 range of ‘Classics’. “Designs like the Les Paul and the SG once again embrace the features and construction details that made them legends in the first place: a Les Paul Standard ’50s spec and a Les Paul Standard ’60s spec as well as one with P-90 pickups,” says Cesar Gueikian, Gibson’s chief merchant officer. “The Contemporary line also introduces a new concept with the Les Paul and SG Modern.” These new ranges “will be available for purchase later this year”. What that means for these original and clearly short-lived 2019 models that are in-store is anyone’s guess, but we suspect as the year progresses there will be deals aplenty to be had (2018 models are already discounted in many stores). Whatever happens while the dust settles, it looks like 2019 is going to be quite a year for Gibson lovers. Watch this space! ",roland-fp-10-digital-piano-review
"Roland’s FP line of portable digital pianos features a range of models to suit all budgets. To that end, the entry-level Roland FP-10 model aims to provide beginners and hobbyists with a premium acoustic piano sound, together with a high-quality weighted keyboard, all at an affordable price. The foremost indicators of Roland’s no-compromise approach to the FP-10 are its wonderfully playable PHA4 keybed and SuperNatural sound engine. Identical to those found in much more expensive Roland models such as the HP702, finding these features in a beginner digital piano is a real bonus. All 88 keys are individually and progressively weighted, heavier at the low end and gradually becoming lighter towards the top. Furthermore, uniquely at this price point, there’s an escapement mechanism in there to enable the rapid playing of repeated notes, and the keys also have a very realistic ivory feel to the key-tops, so in terms of feeling like an acoustic piano, the FP-10 scores highly. Among the narrowest in its class, the FP-10 has a very slim profile front to back but is also unusually tall for a digital keyboard, the deep casing accommodating the escapement mechanism and the two 6W downward-firing speakers. At 14cm, the height may pose an issue if you’re thinking of using it as a master MIDI keyboard to sit in a drawer under a tabletop. It’s a substantial unit at 12.3kg, but not so overweight as to rule it out as a portable instrument. Connection-wise, the only audio output is a single 3.5mm headphone jack, the lack of separate line outs being the clearest indication yet that the FP-10 is aimed at the domestic user rather than the professional stage and studio musician. There are two USB ports - one for future firmware updates, the other to connect the FP-10 to your computer for use as a MIDI controller - and a damper pedal port. Although the FP-10 supports half-pedalling, the basic bundled foot switch doesn’t - you’ll need to invest in a compatible pedal like the Roland DP-10 to take advantage of this feature. The FP-10’s top panel is a masterclass in minimalism, the only controls being four illuminated buttons on the left hand side - one for powering on, two for adjusting volume, and a fourth ‘piano function’ switch. When held down, this transforms the instrument’s keys into function selector switches, performing duties such as switching preset tones, controlling metronome settings, adjusting brilliance and ambience levels, master tuning and playback of demo songs. We’re not big fans of having to use the piano keys as switches for functions, but this arrangement presumably helps keep the overall cost of the unit down. It works well enough, but it’s a two-handed affair, and since there’s no display of any kind, changing sounds can be difficult in low light conditions. Fifteen onboard sounds are provided, most prominent of which are the four acoustic pianos, which are of excellent quality but with seemingly only subtle differences in character. Full, rich and exquisitely detailed, the acoustic piano sounds are derived from the same SuperNatural sound set as Roland's more expensive models, meaning that advanced characteristics such as simulated sympathetic string resonance, damper resonance and key-off resonance are all present and correct. Next up, there are two electric piano sounds, of which one is a Fender Rhodes sample and the other a DX7-style FM EPiano. There are two harpsichords, a vibraphone, a Hammond B3 jazz organ, a pipe organ, two string patches, a gorgeous soft analogue pad and the strange ‘jazz scat’ preset, a novelty collection of velocity-sensitive vocal samples that it’s hard to see being of any use to anyone after an initial ten minutes of hilarity. Sadly, there’s no onboard Wurlitzer EP200 preset - we’d have gladly forsaken the frankly bonkers jazz scat in favour of a decent Wurli sound accessible from the front panel. Sounds can be layered by pressing two of the keys to select two presets simultaneously - a feature known as ‘Dual Play’ - and there are some useful combinations to be explored in this way, such as acoustic piano and strings, or harpsichord and pad. You can also divide the keyboard into two ‘twin’ pianos, one on the left and one on the right so that two people can play the same pitch ranges, which is great for student/teacher interaction. When paired with Roland’s Piano Partner 2 app, the FP-10 starts to spread its wings a little. After a simple Bluetooth pairing procedure, the app turns your Bluetooth-enabled iOS or Android device into the large-screen touch display that the FP-10 lacks out of the box, the supplied music rest doubling nicely as a tablet stand. Not only do you now have touch control over all major settings and keyboard modes, but you suddenly have access to a further 21 hitherto undiscovered sounds, such as Ragtime Piano, a third, more Wurli-esque electric piano tone, plus a whole bunch of others including Harp, Celeste, Steel and Nylon Guitars, Choirs and more. Although there’s no onboard song recorder on the FP-10, you can use the Piano Partner app, or indeed any other DAW, to record MIDI performances over Bluetooth. Sadly though, there’s no Bluetooth audio feature to allow you to stream audio through the onboard speakers to play along to, as found on the Roland GO:PIANO. The FP-10’s success has been highlighted by how hard it’s been to get hold of in some territories, demand outstripping supply over the course of the pandemic. And for good reason - the quality of the piano sounds and the excellent keybed make it a no-brainer at this price. That weighted PHA4 keyboard means that the FP-10 is no toy - this is a serious instrument, the action possibly a touch on the heavy side for smaller hands, but no more so than that of a real acoustic piano. So if you’re learning the piano, and if you can get hold of one, the exceptional  FP-10 has to be near the top of your shopping list.",gibson-les-paul-classic-2019
"The company's most affordable entry-level upright, Yamaha’s b1 is one of the world’s best-selling acoustic pianos - take a tour round any music college or university music department and you’re likely to find yourself tripping over at least five of them. But does it deserve its position at the top of the bestsellers list? We visited Yamaha Music’s flagship store in the heart of London’s West End to find out. A compact, foreshortened cousin of the much-revered and pricier U1 full-size upright, the b1 is exactly what you’d expect to find next to the dictionary definition of a modern upright piano - classical and understated in terms of cabinet design, with minimal frills. Premium upright pianos are expensive items, so as such the b1 represents exceptional value for money as a starter piano. The quality of the fixtures and fittings is obvious, from the brass hinge-work on the folding fallboard to the folding music desk that spans roughly half the length of the keyboard across the centre. The cabinet finish is as high quality as it gets - we tested the polished ebony version, which shone like a mirror under the showroom lights, but polished mahogany, walnut and white finishes are also available, as well as an ebony version with chrome furniture instead of the standard brass. In contrast to their digital piano counterparts, acoustic pianos only have one sound, so with just one job to do it’s important that it’s done well. Considering that the b1 is the shortest piano in the b-series range at 109 cm (eclipsed in size by its 113 cm b2 and 121 cm b3 stablemates) the sound it produces is remarkably rewarding. Built in Yamaha's Indonesia factory, the b1’s relatively small stature means that it has shorter strings and shorter keys than some of its larger siblings, and it also features a laminated plywood soundboard to keep production costs down and thus maintain its affordability. Despite this, the tone is wonderfully clear and bright with rich, resonant bass, sparkling highs and a wide dynamic range that rewards enthusiastic playing with a boisterous, room-filling voice, while a gentler touch draws out correspondingly softer, more delicate tones. Because the b1 has been designed primarily with beginners in mind, the keyboard has a relatively light action which is very easy for newbies to get to grips with but at the same time perfectly suitable for the more intermediate or advanced pianist. It feels exceptionally responsive under the fingers, and as an acoustic instrument it exhibits exactly the degree of natural expressiveness that digital pianos try so hard to emulate. Rapid playing of repeated notes is easily facilitated by the built-in single escapement action found as standard on an acoustic upright - no faking it here. Our above statement that acoustic pianos only have one sound is turned on its head somewhat by Yamaha's SILENT Piano technology, a standout feature on the options list for not just the b1 but for almost any Yamaha acoustic piano. It works by placing a physical barrier in between the hammers and the strings, which prevents the strings being struck and brings into play a row of optical sensors located beneath the keys. The sensors detect what you play and route the information to an internal digital sound source, which in the b1's case is what Yamaha calls the SC2 module. This effectively turns the piano into a digital instrument, muting the strings and allowing you to play through headphones without disturbing the neighbours. Unlike other manufacturers who offer a similar feature, Yamaha builds its silent pianos as standalone instruments at the factory, rather than retrofitting the system to an existing standard piano. Switching to silent mode is done by pushing the middle pedal down and switching it to the left. This positions the shank stopper in such a way as to maintain the maximum amount of physical hammer movement, thus preserving the natural playing feel of the keys. Weirdly though, on the example of the b1 SC2 that we tried, the keys somehow felt ever-so slightly stiffer than those on the regular version, although there shouldn’t be any real reason for this as the internal acoustic piano mechanisms are identical. In acoustic mode, the b1 SC2 sounds rich, bright and full, identical to the acoustic model. Meanwhile, the SC2 module’s ten onboard sounds are excellent, with sampled versions of Yamaha's flagship CFX and Bosendorfer Imperial grand pianos to choose from, plus a selection of electric pianos, organs and possibly the best harpsichord emulation we’ve ever tried. Being able to revert from what is essentially a top-notch digital piano back to the full acoustic at the flick of a pedal is a joyous experience. You do pay something of a premium for all this extra functionality, with an RRP more than a thousand pounds higher than the standard version of the b1, but if you really need the best of both worlds this is undeniably an effective solution.",yamaha-b1-acoustic-piano-review
"Yamaha's Arius range of stylish, budget-friendly digital home console-style pianos received a refresh in early 2022, which saw the introduction of two new slimline versions of the existing, full-size models. As a result, the range now consists of four pianos, the YDP-165, YDP-145, YDP-S55 and YDP-S35, all designed to combine the elegant form and rich tone of a traditional acoustic piano with the compact footprint and practicality of a digital piano. The YDP designation stands for Yamaha Digital Piano, and while the 145 and 165 are the two full-size models, the S denomination represents the Slimline models, shallower from front to back to allow them to fit into smaller living spaces. Of the two, the S35 is the more affordable, while the S55, the focus of this review, is the more premium model, meaning that the S55 is to all intents and purposes the same piano as the 165 but in a more compact cabinet. The main difference between the S55 and the S35 is that the S55 features an enhanced Yamaha CFX grand piano sound, a more powerful speaker system and Yamaha’s GH3 keyboard (with an extra third sensor), rather than the GHS (Graded Hammer Standard) keyboard found in the S35. The GH3 features 88 full-size, weighted plastic keys that are graded in weight from heavier on the left to lighter in the upper octaves, just like on an acoustic piano. The keys in the GH3 are designed to bounce back faster than those in the GHS, responding more like high-quality piano keys, and that extra third sensor allows improved rapid note repetition and expressive control, making the S55 an extremely satisfying instrument to play. Where the S35's keys have a smooth matt finish, the keytops on the S55 are textured to reduce slippage when things get really frenetic! With regard to cabinet design, the S55 has a modern, minimalist look that has a lot to do with the fact that it's so amazingly compact. Measuring a mere 309mm from front to back, the YDP-S series is one of the slimmest console-style home digital pianos on the market, perfect if you're a bit strapped for space. When not in use, the folding keyboard cover becomes a flat, tabletop-like surface when closed, giving the instrument something of the look of a hallway table. To facilitate student/teacher interaction, there are twin 6.3mm headphone sockets located just far enough forwards on the underside of the keyboard to be accessible without needing to crawl underneath, and there’s also a Duo mode that splits the keyboard into two four-octave pianos, so teacher and student can play together side by side. Adjacent to the headphone jacks sits a USB port that's used to connect to a computer so you can use your piano as a MIDI controller. With just 10 sounds on board, Yamaha have clearly gone for quality over quantity here - you get the same number of internal sounds as the rest of the YDP range. Largely because of this, the S55 is simple to operate, scoring highly in our ‘turn on and play’ test. The meticulously-sampled CFX grand piano tone is excellent, and the reduced depth of the cabinet doesn't have the detrimental effect on the sound that you might expect - we anticipate that some black magic trickery has taken place in the design of the 2 x 20W speaker array (as opposed to 2 x 8W on the S35) to facilitate this, as the main CFX grand piano sound is full and rich. Yamaha’s entry-level virtual resonance modelling technology, VRM Lite, is present here too, giving you convincing sympathetic resonance between adjacent notes when the damper pedal is held down, mimicking the way the strings, soundboard and cabinet interact on an acoustic piano. Aside from the CFX concert grand, the other voices are more than serviceable - the Rhodes and DX E-piano tones tick all the boxes, along with the harpsichord, vibraphone and organ tones. On the downside, we did encounter a curious lack of sustain on the strings voice, a foible common to the other models in the Arius range, and being Wurli fans, we really would have appreciated a Wurlitzer EP200A voice in there somewhere to fuel our Fleetwood Mac obsession - it’s only logical after all! In terms of extra features, there's not an incredibly long list - there's no Bluetooth for example, so you can't stream audio through the piano's speakers to play along to. However, you do get Intelligent Acoustic Control, which corrects the sound balance optimally according to the volume you set, plus a Stereophonic Optimizer to make playing while using headphones a more immersive experience, both of which seem to do what they say on the tin. The real bonus though, is that like the other Ariuses, the S55 is compatible with Yamaha’s free Smart Pianist app for mobile devices. This transforms a handy iPad or Android tablet into a large touchscreen display for your piano, making it much easier to access the internal settings. You can use the iPad to change voices, call up the scores of the built-in songs and use the Piano Room function to adjust the tonal quality and resonance settings of the piano tone in a much easier to use visual environment. It really does change the functionality of the instrument to a serious degree, making it easier to work with the 10 demo songs, 50 classical onboard songs and 303 lesson songs.",yamaha-arius-ydp-s55-review
"Offering an all-solid wood build of sexy Sitka spruce on top and okoume on the back and sides, Cort's Gold-OC6 is a cutaway acoustic guitar of considerable poise and bearing. No wonder they assigned this the 'Gold' designation. Only, someone forgot to tell marketing that the price should be higher. Seriously, you pull it out of the gig-bag and you'll be shocked you've paid three figures for it. Complementing those solid woods are a set of Grover deluxe vintage gold tuners, a Macassar ebony fretboard, abalone rosette, and, invisible to the naked eye, the guitar's Sitka spruce top has been treated with Cort's own torrefaction processed, Aged to Vintage. We'll call it AVT hereafter and explain it thus; the wood is heated, the moisture and oils dry out and the wood resonates like an acoustic that might have been able to tell you where they were the day Kennedy got shot. That means more brightness, more clarity, more... More everything. There really is nothing quite like a vintage acoustic guitar tone, but the AVT – and indeed the torrefaction processes we are seeing in a number of acoustics at this price and higher – does a good job of nudging it on the way. On the shoulder you'll find controls for the Fishman Flex Blend system – volume, tone and blend – and the LED display for the tuner. The Flex system uses an under-saddle pickup and onboard mic that gives players a healthy degree of control over their tone. Elsewhere, we've got a nato, (or 'eastern mahogany') neck strengthened by walnut strips and attached to the body with a double-lock neck joint. Hey, we did say you'd question the price. There's a lot of guitar craft for the price. There is a lot of access to that ebony fretboard, with a nice and generous cutaway. Fret a few chords and you'll notice that the 43mm bone nut is a little on the tight side for fingerstyle – a personal preference for many, while others, especially those with smaller digits, won't care a jot. There's a lovely amount of volume, though. And there is no shortage of clarity. As you might expect from an OM acoustic, there's a nice width and three-dimensional weight to its tone, albeit with exceptional brightness. There will be no trouble being heard with this. The Fishman Flex Blend system's under-saddle piezo and mic combo does an excellent job of amplifying the Gold-OC6 without stepping all over the tone, though a few subtle tweaks of its tone control and the right amount of blend will scoop the EQ nicely to suit percussive and fingerstyles. In terms of features, Cort has been more than generous. For the money, the Gold-OC6 is hard to resist. If you've got fingers like Mr Tickle's arms and eschew a pick, that nut width will suggest you look otherwise. But those looking for a serious option for the stage and plenty change from a grand would do well to pick it up and test its mettle. MusicRadar verdict: A very attractive cutaway electro-acoustic at a very attractive price. The Cort Gold-OC6 is a great strummer with an all-solid build that should be a ready and willing companion onstage.",cort-gold-oc6
"Taylor Academy’s proposition is proper guitars for - in Taylor terms - not a lot of money: making the “acoustic guitar accessible to more players”. This nylon string is also, by design, aimed at the younger starter player. It might be entry level in terms of Taylor’s range but, not least in this nylon electro form, it’s hardly low-end with serious competition from the likes of Yamaha and Cordoba, who have ‘posher’ spec’d nylon electros at the same, or lower, price-points. Taylor’s smallest full-scale shape, the Grand Concert, is the perfect size for a ‘classical’ nylon-string. The 12e-N falls, slightly, into the ‘crossover’ style, not least with its ES-N under- saddle and small-footprint basic preamp, lightly cambered fingerboard and relatively narrow neck. That said, its full depth and non-cutaway style, not to mention its dot inlaid fingerboard, makes it look more like a 00/000 with the ‘wrong’ strings. In typical Taylor style, however, its build is as clean as a whistle. The satin varnish finish is about as thin as it gets which will no doubt enhance its resonance though it provides little protection; the back of the mahogany neck (with separate head and heel block) and the sapele veneers have an almost open-pore textural feel. We do get an adjustable truss rod - not part of traditional classicals - and strap buttons on both heel and base, the latter doubling as the output jack which is firmly screwed in place. Along with the classical-style tuners, the tie-block bridge is classy; the slightly compensated Tusq saddle angled back to ensure good down pressure over the under-saddle transducer. Fretting too is superbly consistent. The Taylor is set a shade under 3mm on the trebles and bang on 3mm on the bass side. The Taylor’s voice is classical with an open midrange; hit hard it has an almost flamenco-like character yet played in a more relaxed Latin-style its voicing allows clear representation of the often complex jazzier chords of that genre. The guitar’s tuners - machineheads and the onboard digital tuner - work efficiently. The latter is extremely handy on a nylon string, as they take more time to settle to consistent pitch compared to steel. Plugged in, we really can’t fault the Taylor; it is crisp, balanced and with a low end that won’t run away with you. Onstage you might rely on a floor tuner or outboard preamps, which suits the simplistic Taylor. The Taylor’s soundhole is circular and will take a soundhole bung. There are very few negatives. The Taylor impesses in terms of neck shape, size, playability and comes with a crisp, defined voicing. It comes at a price though, bringing in some serious competition. As ever, if you’re new to the parallel universe of the nylon string: play as many as you can and find your fit. ",taylor-academy-12e-n
"We have seen what the Fender Player Plus series has done for the electric guitar, with brand touchstones such as the Stratocaster and Telecaster models refreshed in hot new finishes, souped-up with noiseless pickups and with a 12” fingerboard radius to modernise them. But how does the Player Plus series look from a bass player’s POV? Here we have one of the most influential bass guitar designs of all time, the Fender Jazz Bass, augmented with the new broom of the Player Plus. That means we see Noiseless pickups, a Modern C profile maple neck with rolled fingerboard edges. Like its six-string kin, this Jazz Bass opts for the 12” radius fingerboard, giving it a different feel from its counterparts in the regular Player series, which have a more recognisably Fender 9.5” radius. The Jazz Bass is a design that has been tweaked relentlessly over decades of innovation, and yet it always retains that sense of itself, with its slightly offset silhouette offering a very player-friendly chassis to build upon. The Player Plus Jazz Bass assumes this form, with a solid alder body, a neck that joins the body with a four-bolt joint and F-branded neckplate. Like the Player series fingerboard materials are dependent on finish option with the choice of maple on the Olympic Pearl and Aged Candy Apple Red models, and pau ferro with the Belair Blue and 3-Color Sunburst. While our Aged Candy Apple Red model feels very on-brand, the Belair Blue is very new for Fender. It’s a gradient burst finish that looks like the instrument has been dip-dyed. Very cool. But a strong look. The Noiseless pickups assume the same footprint as your typical Jazz single-coil but, of course, arrive with promises of humbucking performance, and these are controlled by a tweakable preamp that offers controls for master volume, pan, and a three-band EQ, plus there is a toggle switch for alternating between the Player Plus Jazz Bass’s active and passive modes. Elsewhere, Fender has equipped the Player Plus Jazz Bass with a super-solid HiMass bridge whose saddles fit into slots and promise on-point intonation. All the things that have made the Jazz Bass such an enduring instrument are evident in the Player Plus model. No one could call it a lightweight bass by any stretch. It’s 10lb in its underwear. But those body contours help balance it, and with that Modern C neck profile – the primo touch of rolled fingerboard edges giving it that worn-in feel – the Player Plus Jazz Bass is one comfortable ride. Priced at the top of Fender’s Mexican-built range, the Player Plus models have been nicknamed the ‘Mexican Ultra’ series for good reason. Okay, the modernisation only goes so far. We don’t have sculpted heels a la the American Ultra or American Professional II models. But there’s no question this feels right for today’s player. The notes pop off the fingerboard and the neck’s satin finish offers little resistance even to sweaty hands. Finding a sound has never been easier. Old-school Jazz growl is right there where you want it on the passive mode, a sound that’s upfront, articulate and very on-brand for the model. But there’s plenty of opportunity to dial in a wide range of bass sounds. That’s a key factor in the success of the Jazz Bass – and indeed the Precision – over the years. Anyone can pick up one of these and apply their style to the instrument. Its active performance yields superlative control over your EQ. Bass and treble occupy one stacked pot. Midrange, where so often the battle for great tone is one, has its own dedicated control. As per house style, these controls are mounted on a metal plate that abuts a four-ply tortoiseshell pickguard. As we have come to expect from Fender’s Ensenada facility, the fit and finish is bang-on. Having wowed us with the time machine vibe of the Vintera, this Player Plus series brings us a contemporary alternative. Those ready for something bold might prefer Belair Blue, but Aged Candy Apple Red is really something. No question, the Player Plus Jazz Bass would make a fine choice for the gigging pro or serious amateur. It would make an excellent first serious bass, quite possibly why Fender has enthusiastically marketed the Player Plus series to a younger cohort while offering finish options and a performance that Jazz fans of all vintages can get down with. MusicRadar verdict: An evolutionary rather than revolutionary step, the Player Plus Jazz Bass is proof once more of the format’s enduring appeal, with a ‘deluxe’ spec positioning it as a serious bass for not-so-serious money.",fender-player-plus-jazz-bass
"Fender's American Ultra Series marks a new era for the Californian guitar giant. It replaces the American Elite Series, rolling out a number of contemporary features, new finishes and the promise that you will ""never play a Fender the same way again."" We'll see how that plays out to the traditionalists weaned on Hank Marvin – and besides, we've still got the American Original Series if we want a vintage-minded option at a reasonable price – but in the here and now that means that Fender's flagship US-built line should have everything today's player is looking for. The newly designed noiseless pickups and a more ergonomically sculpted heel were the big talking points with the electric guitars, and these have made their way onto both the Fender American Ultra Jazz Bass and Precision Bass. So, too, the newly carved Modern D neck profile, the compound radius fingerboards with ""extremely rolled edges"" and enhanced contouring on the body. Both our American Ultra Jazz and P-Bass Bound share 10”-14” compound-radius fingerboards, with 21 medium-jumbo frets. They also welcome the debut of the HiMass bridge and onboard preamps have been redesigned with a three-band boost/cut EQ and switchable active or passive circuits. The Precision Bass has a split-coil Ultra Precision Bass pickup in the middle position and an Ultra Jazz Bass in bridge while the Jazz has two Ultra Noiseless Vintage Jazz Bass pickups in the neck and bridge positions. The finishes are pretty tidy, too, with our Jazz resplendent in Texas Tea – an oily off-black colour. It is one of the finest Fender has come up with in a while, but then the new Mocha Burst, sadly not available for the Jazz, is another stunner. We'd forecast some agonising decisions when it comes to the finishes. But is the American Ultra Series really such a radical update on the American Elite models, which were introduced in 2016 to widespread acclaim? Let's take a look... The Jazz Bass offers you the option to run it active or passive. We went for the latter first and found that, despite this being a bold move into the future for Fender, the tones were reassuringly familiar. There were warm, rounded tones in the neck pickup, redolent of the pre-internet age, and that sharper, more defined attack in the bridge. In passive mode, the three-band EQ is offline so you only have as master tone control for tweaking. This is what you would expect, and yet there is something a little bit different, as the Noiseless pickups clean everything up nicely – even at high volumes. The active mode kicks the Jazz up a notch. There is a lot of tone to play with here. Treble and bass controls share one stacked tone control with the midrange position of the other stacked control. Dialling in a little more bass will give you that little something extra on the frequency floor, a tone that will really bring out the best in slap players. The midrange control is similarly musical, adding an expansive range and an up-front punch that's ideal for busier passages, Jaco-style fingerstyle, that sort of thing. A little goes a long way here, though, as the active tone controls have plenty of sweep. The Precision's controls are set up similarly, though only the split-coil is operational in the passive mode. You'll find this to be a on-the-money when it comes to classic P-Bass tones. There's that low end solidity, the warmth, and then that more mid-heavy sound that pares nicely with a pick. In active mode, there's a heap of range. If the bridge pickup is close to the Jazz, the neck pickup and the EQ is positioned just nicely to unearth a heap of interesting tones that should please most players. Both the Precision and the Jazz are super-comfortable to play. The light-weight vintage paddle keys help balance things out while the Modern D neck profile strikes a neat compromise between offering a fast feel and offering the player something substantial to hold onto. The satin finish is a winner, too. As for the hardware, the HiMass bridge is a neat piece of engineering, designed with stability and sustain in mind, and it is easily adjusted. The most radical changes are in the body contouring, and a neck heel that invites some upper-fret adventurism. Not everyone needs it but it's an easy fix to make and we're glad Fender made it. The build quality is exceptional throughout. Sure, this is Fender taking a leap into the future, but they have also been mindful of the past, and when you pick up a Precision or a Jazz there are certain expectations of tone and feel, and, ultimately, these are not going to alienate anyone whose favourite bass predates the colour TV. At this price, the competition is fierce. There are cheaper alternatives that might offer similar features. But then, we are drawn back to the gold-foil logo on the headstock, and the idea of a premium US-built Fender is never going to go out of style, whatever its vintage. This is a worthy update.",gibson-les-paul-junior-tribute-doublecut-bass-review
"This year is Vox’s 60th birthday, a rare event for any manufacturer and one that underlines Vox’s legendary status in the electric guitar universe. As part of the celebrations, we’ve already been treated to a bevy of stunning new products this year, and here we’re looking at a tempting amp that combines cutting-edge technology with vintage style and tone in typical Vox fashion: the AC30S1 combo. The AC30S1 is essentially a stripped-down AC30, with a single channel based on the classic Top Boost circuit and a slightly narrower cabinet holding a single 12-inch loudspeaker. This amp is dressed in full-on traditional Vox livery, with black basketweave vinyl, brown diamond grill cloth and suitably proportioned gold logo badge. However, underneath the vintage looks the electronics are thoroughly modern. Two main PCBs support most of the electronics including the valve sockets, with a smaller daughter board for the amp’s digital reverb effect. Everything is neatly wired up and connected by Molex plugs, making servicing easy if it’s needed. The semi-closed back cabinet means the valves aren’t so easy to get to, but this is the case with many AC30 variants. The combo features a single input, feeding controls for gain, bass, treble, master volume and reverb. There’s a simple series effects loop on the rear panel together with an extension speaker outlet, and that’s your lot with this ‘back to basics’ version. The AC30S1 has an energy-saving power supply that switches the amp off if no audio is detected for around 15 minutes. Thankfully, there’s a small switch to turn this function off. The power toggle switch has been replaced with a momentary action type that operates a relay, which feels a little odd at first, but we quickly got used to it. Overall, this amp is built to the typically high standards we’ve come to expect from Vox today: built to last as well as looking great. We auditioned the amp with a variety of guitars, including a Gibson Custom Shop ’63 ES-335, a PAF-loaded Les Paul and our Duncan Alnico Pro-loaded Strat. Like all cathode-biased amps, the AC30S1 takes a little while for its voltages to stabilise. After a few minutes though, initial hum fades away and the amp is remarkably quiet. The controls are deceptively simple, with a wide range of gain and tone that makes it easy to dial in any guitar. Low gain settings produce slightly boxy mids and a medium-fast attack, evoking many classic pop instrumentals from the 60s, especially when mixed with Vox’s digital spring reverb. This effect is excellent and matches many studio effect/plugins for quality, with a range that goes from natural background ambience to full-on cavern. Even with the level control maxed out, the effect doesn’t overpower the guitar and works well for authentic 60s guitar sounds. If you pick ‘Marvin style’, using the bridge pickup of a Strat and holding the trem with your little finger so the pick is roughly over the neck pickup, any decent delay in the AC30S1’s effects loop will get you a satisfyingly authentic Shadows sound. Take the reverb off, add a little more gain and you’ll find a perfect Beatles Top Boost jangle, which sounds superb with our ES-335. Pushing up the gain to about halfway takes you into the Blues Invasion era, with a singing sustain and a touch- sensitive toothy attack that compliments any guitar. It’s ideal for blues players looking for a slightly more aggressive edge to their tone, compared to the regular ‘benchmark’ tweed sound. Diming the gain and tones comes very close to classic Queen, with maybe a touch more gain needed for lower output pickups. The single Celestion VX12 speaker in this near closed-back cabinet produces plenty of volume and bottom end, with a slightly more focused treble when you listen on-axis compared to a 2x12 enclosure. Vox was originally built on innovation and over the last 25 years that pioneering spirit has continued to flourish under Korg’s ownership, allowing the brand to achieve its true potential as one of the world’s top musical instrument brands. The AC30S1 is an ideal no-frills AC30 for players after a modern interpretation of the Top Boost tone wrapped up in traditional looks. It’s certainly more portable than 2x12 versions, without sacrificing anything significant in terms of tone or volume. Despite its simplicity, the sounds are very versatile and well-suited for 60s, indie, classic rock, blues, country... and much more. So, another great amp in Vox’s catalogue and another niche effectively - and very temptingly - filled.",vox-ac30s1-combo
"Fender has revealed the latest addition to its Tone Master range of guitar amps; the Princeton Reverb 1x10. The £799 combo will be available from November and sees Fender continuing its commitment to recreating its iconic tube amp models as lighter weight, digital combos without compromising on tone. It says a lot that the reliability of Tone Masters due to their components (no valve replacements needed urgently on a show day) has seen Lenny Kravitz and Mike McCready using them on the road recently. And the slightly lower price of this 1x10"" model compared to the other Tone Master models. The lighter weight pine cabinets used for Tone Masters also make a massive difference to lug around, and with built-in IR cab simulations, you also have flexibility. We've also been very impressed at the results of DI recording with Tone Masters in the past. With the onboard reverb and tremolo effects further sweetening the deal with the Princeton. And while the term 'pedal platform' gets thrown around a bit too frequently these days for our liking, it really does apply to a lot of Fender's combos for their high headroom with sparkling cleans. A lovely canvas for you to get gain stacking over with overdrive pedals! The speaker here is a 10"" Jensen C10R and for using on stage and in your home there's an output power selector for full power and five attenuated settings, alongside the balanced XLR line output with the onboard impulse response (IR) cabinet sims. There's also a hand-mute switch for silent stage or recording use.",fender-tone-master-princeton-chorus-amp
"Casio’s iconic Casiotone brand of portable electronic keyboards first brought affordable home keyboards to the market in the early 1980s but disappeared from the limelight at some point in the mid-1990s. In 2019, however, Casio took the welcome step of relaunching the brand with four new Casiotone models, the CT-S100, CT-S200, CT-S300, and LK-S250. Of these four, the LK-S250 was the top of the line until the introduction of the more pro-spec CT-S1, CT-S400 and LK-S450 Casiotone models in July 2021. The LK-S250, then, is a lightweight, 61-key, portable electronic keyboard that can either be mains-powered or run off batteries. The ace up its sleeve is its illuminated keys feature, where each key contains a built-in red LED that guides you to play the correct notes when learning songs. Combine this with an onboard lesson feature, 60 built-in songs and compatibility with Casio’s free Casio Music Space mobile app (formerly known as Chordana Play) and you have what looks like an attractive package for those with children who want something small and light, with full-size keys, but which has a range of features designed to make learning easy and fun. What we did find frustrating when we unboxed our LK-S250 review unit was the lack of any means of powering the instrument, with no mains power supply or batteries included. Our recommendation would be to check with your retailer that a PSU is included, as experiences seem to be varied in this regard according to the territory you’re purchasing in. The first thing you notice about the LK-S250 is just how light and easy to carry around this thing is. The cleverly designed integrated carrying handle lends this keyboard a large degree of flingability, which if you’re under ten years old is a bonus, making it easy to carry and set up from room to room. The handle takes the form of a void in the upper region of the casing that has the added benefit of doubling up as a receptacle for the matching music rest to slot into. This is an essential add-on if you’re intending to use a tablet with your Casiotone, as it’s the perfect place to pop an iPad when running the Casio Music Space app. With no onboard Bluetooth, however, connecting a device to run the Music Space app falls down to having the correct cable to hand, as again, none was included. The LK-S250 sports a micro USB B connector on the back, which in the case of an iPad needs to be hooked up to the lightning connector via a USB Camera Connection Kit in order to work. Once up and running, we found the interface pretty easy to get to grips with, with an informative four-line LCD display navigated via three soft buttons and a jog wheel. Sadly the display isn’t backlit, making it difficult to read in low light. The twin 2.5W speaker system goes plenty loud enough for most home practising scenarios but was a bit lacking in low-end grunt. A big selling point for the LK-S250 is its educational appeal. As such, the keys are extremely easy to play, with a very light action and a noticeably shallow travel. They do feel very plasticky, no doubt due to the translucency required to allow them to light up, but this in no way affects playability. In use, the red key lights are supremely bright and look very impressive in darkened surroundings. The LK-S250’s onboard lesson system is actually pretty useful for learning simple songs, with the usual smattering of 60 simple classical pieces and traditional folk tunes such as ‘Fur Elise’ and ‘Ave Maria’. The key light system has four modes, Easy, Listen, Watch and Remember. With Easy mode engaged, you can press any key to advance to the next note, correct or not. Listen plays the song and lights up the keys so you can listen to the piece and see it being performed with the lights showing you which notes to play. Watch is the mode where you have to play the correct key to advance to the next note, and Remember delays the lights, only prompting you with the correct note if you fail to play it after a few seconds. After progressing through the modes, your fingers start to take on muscle memory so that you can feel the tune and no longer need the lights to be a crutch. Once you get used to the system, it does work pretty well, but you can only have a maximum of four notes lit at any time and some of the timing aspects can be confusing, especially if you’re playing a baroque piece that features trills. The Casio Music Space app adds a whole new dimension to the learning system, with a piano roll/Synthesia-style cascade method of learning songs that also illuminates the keys during lesson playback. Unfortunately, due to a lack of the required cable, we were unable to test this feature. We did enjoy the app’s Concert Play element though, which adds a beautifully-arranged orchestral backing to a score display of a library of famous classical pieces good enough to make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. The LK-S250 has a generous 400 tones on board, but sadly not many of them are particularly inspiring. The grand piano sound is just about passable, with the addition of an optional damper pedal. The electric pianos are okay, while the harpsichord is frankly dismal and many of the other tones are simply just average. The majority of them seemed to lack the professional polish of, say, the sounds found on the Yamaha E-series keyboards. Interestingly, its pricier cousin the LK-S450 boasts Casio’s AiX sound engine, which features a much more professional-sounding palette of voices. There’s no pitch bend or mod wheel on the S250, and no way to edit the sounds other than changing or removing the reverb effect. The 77 rhythms are standard arranger keyboard fare, but each beat does at least get a couple of variations and fill-ins that can be triggered on the fly for a bit of added interest. Equally, the auto-accompaniment feature, where you trigger chords and bass parts by holding down chord shapes with your left hand is functional enough, but something weird was going on in some of the pre-programmed bass lines on some of the parts that we couldn’t quite figure out. Elsewhere, the Dance music feature offers solid entertainment for kids for a while, allowing the triggering of a selection of around 50 sets of pre-rendered drum, bass and synth parts from the keys that can be mixed together with four types of effect on the fly. There are just about enough possible combinations of elements here to hold attention for an afternoon or so, but only if you’re still on the tooth fairy’s client list.",casio-casiotone-lk-s250-keyboard
"Perched on the northwestern shoulder of North America in Bend, Oregon, Breedlove is a brand that has made ecologically conscious acoustic guitar design a priority in recent years. Most famously, it teamed up with the actor Jeff Bridges for a line of signature acoustics using sustainable tonewoods sourced directly by Tom Bedell. No clear-cut wood was used. Furthermore, these eco-builds were offered at a variety of price points. This is where the wind is headed, and it means we are being introduced to altogether unfamiliar tonewoods. Guitar players can often be creatures of habit, exhibiting a little caution when it comes to the raw materials in their instrument, but there is surely something tantalising about an acoustic market that looks being the holy trinity of spruce, mahogany and rosewood – there is the promise of new cadences and tones.The search for tonewoods is global but the drive for sustainability has found brands such as Breedlove and Taylor finding timber treasure on their doorstep. Taylor’s Urban Ash – also known as Shamel or evergreen ash – discovered that the tonal balance and mids-forward punch of Honduran mahogany could be heard in the reclaimed wood that has been felled from city trees across SoCal that was in need of removal anyway. Breedlove similarly has acquired a portfolio of guitars that eschew clear-cut tonewoods, using salvaged timber or individually harvested trees instead, with the myrtlewood of its native Oregon a leitmotif of its designs, and the reason why it is so hard to draw your eyes away from this handsome cutaway acoustic-electric guitar.The Eco Pursuit EX S Concert Sweetgrass assumes Breedlove’s most popular body shape – a compact body measuring 15.37” across the lower bout with a skinny 9” waist – and comprises a solid myrtlewood top, with its back and sides fashioned from myrtlewood and mahogany laminate – the former layered atop the latter to maintain that unique finish. The body and the West African ovangkol fretboard are tidily bound with plastic tortoiseshell – the tortoiseshell reprised in the rosette. This is a smart guitar.The ovangkol has brass dot inlays and has been stained to resemble ebony, making for a nice contrast with the earthy grain and Sweetgrass stain finish of that myrtlewood body. Breedlove has used African mahogany for the neck, which has been hand-rubbed and finished in tactile semi-gloss, while ovangkol has been used for the bridge and headstock facing. As for the vital statistics, the Concert Sweetgrass 20 frets, a 25.3” scale and a 1.69” Graph Tech TUSQ nut, and you’ll find copper closed gear tuners, and a Fishman Presys I under-saddle pickup and preamp rounding out the spec. It really is eye-catching, and you would be forgiven for thinking that this is a high-end acoustic guitar. But the laminate back and sides help keep the price down to a trim £869, making for an eco-conscious and striking cutaway electro that is within the budget for the serious amateur. There’s no question that the Concert Sweetgrass looks the part. Myrtlewood is easy on the eye. How is it on the ears? Some will say its sonic profile is somewhere between maple and rosewood, with big and deep lows, and crisp clarity in the high end. That’s not too dissimilar to what you get here. For a small concert-sized acoustic, there’s a generous amount of bass response, not that it is going to overpower things. Just as the guitar feels when playing it, as does it sound, with balance across the frequency spectrum. This makes the Concert Sweetgrass a bit of an all-rounder. The mids have character. Allied with that bass response, it makes for a confident voice for open chords. Notes last. There’s a definition in those chords, too.This could be a strummer, but it’s voicing lends itself well to playing fingerstyle blues too. The Fishman electronics do not mess around too much with this voicing. There are no treble or bass controls here, simply a contour button which hollows out the mids a little, bringing the bass and treble to the fore, and the all-important guitar tuner. Sometimes that is all you need. The battery compartment is mounted alongside the 1/4” output jack – on the guitar’s lower bout. It might not be as tidy as having an end-pin jack but it does mean no rummaging inside the soundhole in mild panic should you have to change a battery at a gig.This is more than gig-able. The build quality is impressive. The tuning stability is on point. The feel of that C-profile neck is addictive. We would appreciate a gigbag at this price but all things considered, this cutaway is a charmer to make myrtlewood converts of us all, and an affirmation of Breedlove’s eco-conscious builds.MusicRadar verdict: The Concert Sweetgrass is a versatile cutaway electro-acoustic that is easy on our eyes, ears and budget, and on the planet, too, with its myrtlewood top giving it a unique look and a fresh acoustic voice.",breedlove-eco-pursuit-ex-s-concert-sweetgrass
"As befits one of the biggest-selling artists of recent times, Ed Sheeran doesn’t just have a single signature guitar: he has a whole range! But Ed’s a pop artist you moan, why on earth would we be interested? The answer to that lies in the title: Sheeran by Lowden. If you didn’t know, George Lowden is unquestionably one of the world’s top acoustic guitar makers – and has been for many decades. While the Sheeran range pares down the ingredients and design, what you’re getting here is a stage-ready electro-acoustic built to the same exacting standards as a pucker Lowden for a fraction of the price. And it’s not made in a hurry in the far east either. No, these guitars are made at Lowden HQ in County Down, Northern Ireland. Interested now?Our Equals Edition model here is a 3,000-only limited run, but aside from a few details like the ‘=’ inlay at the 7th fret, laser butterfly flourishes on the heel cap and truss rod cover, and a unique to this model inner label, it’s exactly the same as the standard W-04 (which will cost you £90 less), the smallest of two body sizes currently offered.It’s based on the full-blown Wee Lowden, the smallest guitar in their range, which uses a 24” (610mm) scale length, the same as a Fender Jaguar if you want an electric comparison.Yes, a few pounds shy of a grand ain’t cheap in anyone’s book, but the Sheeran by Lowden range kicks off with the acoustic-only cedar/walnut W-01 at £655 which like all the models in the range comes with a sturdy gig bag included.It comes across as a very functional, purposeful and road-ready instrument with zero bling or unnecessary features. The top is solid Sitka spruce while the figured walnut back and sides are actually a five-piece walnut and mahogany lamination.Edge binding is deemed unnecessary. But the neck is high-quality quarter-sawn mahogany, one piece save for an added heel stack, while the fingerboard, bridge and headstock facing are dark brown ebony.Despite the far lower price than a full-blown Lowden, these Sheeran guitars use the same finish which starts off as gloss but is cut back by hand to the super smooth satin we see here. A finish like this means there’s nowhere to hide: no sunbursting or translucent colours to mask shoddy sanding or file marks.The crisp, clean craft continues to the fretwork that uses a medium gauge wire superbly installed on the acoustic-standard 16” radius fingerboard. It actually feels quite electric guitar-like, the ‘C’ profile quite full in the hand with a nut width of 43.6mm and a string spacing of 36mm which splays out to 54.5mm at the bridge.While the .012-.053” gauge strings are probably bigger than most electric players use, the shorter scale here gives a pretty slinky and bend-friendly feel, and you certainly don’t have to stick to 1st-position cowboy chords.  The combination of the compact size and scale length makes a lot of sense for the practising musician – a full-size dreadnought feels huge in comparison – but if you think you’re going to be short-changed in the sound department, think again. While you don’t get that big low-end of a dreadnought, there’s a well-balanced depth here that makes for a rather good recording guitar too – almost as if it’s been pre-EQ’d.You’ll be in for a treat when you want to plug in. LR Baggs doesn’t mess about, and the discrete Element electro system with its soundhole-placed mini-preamp with volume and tone controls is the perfect partner. Along with a flexible film under saddle sensor there’s some tricky stuff going on in that preamp, too, and plugged into an acoustic amp or larger PA, it sounds much bigger than its size suggests, with little piezo ‘quack’. It’s a very credible electro-acoustic sound indeed.MusicRadar verdict: Aside from being very fashionable, small body guitars make for great travel or house guitars but when they’re made as well as this, with an excellent electro system and almost electric guitar-like playability, you have to question why you still bash away on your dreadnought. Superb UK craft with sounds to match. Thanks, Ed – oh, and George!",sheeran-by-lowden-equals-edition
"Weighing in at 12.8kg (28lbs 4oz), the Roland RD64 digital piano is surprisingly heavier than a Nord Electro 4HP but still fairly easy for one person to move. Due to the compact 64-note weighted keyboard, it will also fit into smaller vehicles (again like the E4HP). We're not too keen on the RD64's looks: it's boxy and a bit plasticky with lots of wasted space on the top panel and underneath the keyboard. On the positive side, the buttons, casing and switch gear feel solid.Personally, this writer would have put all the controls in the space under the keyboard (Jupiter 80 style) instead of on the left, which would have made the RD64 shorter and even easier to transport. We would have added some real-time sliders/pads on the top panel too, but that's just us.The 64-note (A to C) Ivory-Feel-G keybed is nicely balanced beneath the fingers with a fast and precise feel. This isn't surprising as it uses the same technology found in Roland's flagship stage pianos. In fact, the RD64 has one of the nicest actions around to play piano sounds from and therefore works well as a controller for DAW related piano playing tasks too. The keys have a grained ivory like surface that helps when you're playing fast with sweaty hands, though we still think 64 notes is too restrictive for serious piano playing and would have preferred instead a 73-note board with all the controls under the keyboard as previously mentioned. Moving on to the onboard sounds, the main SuperNatural grand (selected by the Tone Variation 1 button) is very good indeed, though one particular note (A flat above Middle C) has a weird resonance. That aside, the main piano sound is great for solo piano performances or ensemble work and sounds pretty natural on the whole.Two further variations are accessible via the tone variation buttons: another stereo piano and one in mono, too, which is always handy to have. Further shaping of the sounds can be done with the 2-band EQ and via the two EFX buttons and Reverb button.Unfortunately, these effects are basic at best and can't be edited so you're stuck with them. Surely it wouldn't have taken much effort to include a wider range of effects with a DAW editor? After all, let's not forget this isn't a cheap bit of kit we're looking at! Thankfully, the effects do their jobs well but there's just not enough choice or variation available for the money.It's handy to have the D-Beam for a hands on (or hands off) way to control sounds. Alas, there's no filter to get stuck into and no synth sounds either. As for the rest of the sounds, they're nice to have but very under whelming.The electric pianos sound good when played softly but pretty plasticky when you really start to dig in, and the organs lack a sense of authenticity with a lifeless basic tone. Although, it has to be said the onboard rotary emulation is actually very good.The clavinets are the weakest sounds of the bunch, lacking in both attack and authenticity. They should have been much better for the money and don't cut it next to the current crop of Nord's, Korg's and Yamaha's.Finally, as much as Roland is pushing the RD64 as a MIDI controller, the conspicuous lack of any real time sliders, dials or pads really stunts it in this respect. In general, there's just not enough onboard the RD64 for the modern producer and performer.",roland-rd-64-digital-piano-575154
"Signature bass guitars tend to attract a little more attention. It's only natural. You see the name of, say, Geddy Lee or John Paul Jones, as we have here, on the headstock and expectations are inflated. Often that name comes at a premium, too, with extra artist-inspired spec to sweeten the deal. But is there really that much difference? Here we have the new signature John Paul Jones signature E-Bass from Manson Guitar Works and the Standard E-Bass for comparison.The Standard is priced from £1,699, arrives in Satin Black or the more disco-amenable Night Sky Holosparkle finishes. The JPJ model has a similar silhouette, is priced from £2,399 and comes in either book-matched flamed or quilted maple in Trans Satin Black or the high-gloss Aged Vintage Red Sunburst lacquer [as reviewed].The Standard and JPJ models share a lot of DNA. Both are Czech-built and set up in Ashburton, England. They have the same bodyshape – a pointed doublecut profile with exaggerated horns – and through-neck construction. The body is mahogany, the neck, three-piece maple. We've got a rosewood fingerboard on the Standard and ebony on the JPJ, while both have two-octave necks and a truss rod adjuster conveniently placed just beyond that 24th fret. Both have a familiar 34” scale and 19mm string spacing from a nut width of 40mm. The body contouring makes them fit nicely against the body.Manson has used some quality hardware in the form of Gotoh machine heads and Hipshot Kickass bridges – the JPJ model has a Hipshot Bass Xtender for on-the-fly drop tunings.A pair of Aguilar pickups are controlled in an active circuity by volume, pan and stacked treble and bass knobs. We would have liked a passive mode but that's no biggie for most players. The wiring job is neat and tidy, with shielding in the compartments to keep noise to a minimum – just what you would expect in a premium instrument.As is Manson's want, there are options. For an extra £100 you can get a Luthier's Choice maple top. At first blush, the JBJ bass has a little more heft to it, but there's certainly a consistency of feel across both basses.With its ebony 'board and maple on top, it's maybe no surprise that the JPJ is a bit more upfront and present in the attack. It is a more forthright tone – full and resonant, the JBJ sustains beautifully. With the EQ set flat, there is noticeable difference in the two basses' tones.That is not to say that one is better. There is always a subjective aspect to judging sound, but it is interesting how the different 'board and top represents itself in the JPJ's tone profile. There is width in both basses' tones. Their respective neck pickups are good and fat, with some chewy lower mids to get excited about. Turn the pan control and the bridge control might surprise you – again, it's the width. Having a humbucker there puts some meat on the bones.Mixing the pickups opens up a number of possibilities, but it is quite exceptional how much clarity and richness in the midrange you will find. The electronics are exceptional, too. From a flat response, it's a cinch to dial in a more lithe, bouncy tone profile for slap or something warm and plummy for R&B fingerstyle.The Aguilar nine-volt OBP-2 circuit is all about definition. Up and down the neck, these prove to be articulate instruments, and there's a good range on both bass and treble controls. A little goes a long way here.The E-Bass format features a shallow D-shape neck profile that feels superb. It'll encourage adventurous bassists to cut loose. Manson has got the weight just right on these instruments, too. The balance and ergonomics are hard to beat.But perhaps their greatest feature is their versatility. Whether you choose the Standard or the JPJ model, the design is something you can impress your style upon. All the tones are there; just dial them in.MusicRadar verdict: Versatile, playable and beautifully balanced, Manson's E-Bass series is a crowd-pleaser. The John Paul Jones Signature has got a little extra wow factor – but that comes at a price. Either way, these are high-quality contemporary basses for serious players.",manson-john-paul-jones-signature-e-bass-and-manson-standard-e-bass
"For any budding young shredder looking for their first guitar the CL-22M is an attractive prospect. The combination of a svelte and speedy satin-finished maple neck, a carefully contoured double cutaway body and a pair of powerful humbucking pickups is a template many great guitars have been built on. Of course, we've seen plenty of spec-heavy axes made or broken by the tiniest of details, and at nearly £200 this Knight is going to have a fight on its hands in the face of some stiff competition.One of the first tests with any budget guitar is balance, and sat on the lap for the first time the CL-22M doesn't disappoint. It's lightweight (thanks to the agathis body) but at the same time very sturdy, with the neck being securely fitted and the strings running through the body for extra reinforcement and sustain.The satin-finished maple neck feels silky smooth to the touch, with a nice wide radius that's perfect for sweeping picking and tapping antics. There's also a decent curve to the carve, so you're not left with an Ibanez or Jackson-like flat section at the back. Unfortunately, after extended play we found that the wood had started to display black marks, likely a combination of dirt and wear from the strings. It won't impact playability, but you might want to keep a bottle of fretboard cleaner handy.The frets, on the other hand, have been nicely polished to a good standard - more than can be said for some of the Black Knight's rivals. Strings bends are smooth and the action set at a sensible height, but unfortunately a few minutes of playing reveals a poorer setup than a first impression might suggest. Crucially, the CL-22M suffers from some intonation problems, making chords and single note runs further up the neck occasionally sound out of tune.Tuning stability is also an issue, with string bends often knocking the tuning out by a significant amount on the higher strings. This appears to be mostly down to excess friction on the nut, causing the strings to stick when you're trying to tune them, only to fly out of tune again once stretched.It's a problem that can easily be solved by a good setup in your local guitar shop, but it's also an extra cost to consider that takes the guitar well above the £200 mark.Tuning issues aside, plugged in the CL-22M's twin humbuckers provide a very solid set of tones that should bring a smile to the face of any rock or metal fan. Clean tones are warm and rounded in the neck position, perfect for arpeggiated chord sequences.Introduce a bit of dirt and you're greeted with a fairly generic but perfectly acceptable rock grind that's perfect for punk and hard rock. Wind up the wick to metal levels and the pickups soon start to become a little bit overwhelmed, but the tone is far from unusable. Pair this guitar with a decent amp modeler and you'll be able to cover a lot of ground. Ultimately, the CL-22M is very much a tale of two halves. For such a comfortable and playable guitar it's a shame that a few key areas of the hardware and setup have been overlooked. We feel this guitar does need a setup before it can be properly recommended, and by that point you're working towards the price of an Ibanez, Washburn or Yamaha.Regardless of the niggles, though, the CL-22M is still a quality guitar built on a solid template that many young rockers will appreciate, especially if you can catch it at an even more reasonable street price.",black-knight-cl22m-electric-guitar-567540
